              Hi I'm Rosie
          </p>
          <p>
              I recently qualified as a play therapist in 2018. I am a full member of the British Association of Play Therapists (BAPT).

              Prior to my training, I have worked with many children with different needs and abilities. Alongside being a babysitter and au pair, I have also worked as a Special Educational Needs teaching assistant within SEN schools in London.
              I have also volunteered within the play specialist department at St Georges Hospital, London and taken performing arts summer school classes at a local sports centre in Dorset.

              I originally trained as an actress in musical theatre but I realised that I was wanting to channel my energy and passion for the arts into working with children.
              I originally thought about teaching performing arts to children but realised that my heart truly laid with children who may have suffered a little more in life than others.
