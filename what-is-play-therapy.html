        <p>
          When children suffer a traumatic event or are just finding things a
          little bit hard, words may be difficult to use when expressing how
          they feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Play therapy is an opportunity for children to explore feelings and
          emotions through the form of play, taking pressure off needing to use
          words and focusing on a playful and more approachable method to help
          them without feeling interrogated or threatened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Play therapy can help in a variety of ways. Not only do they receive
          emotional support from the play therapist, they can also learn and
          understand more about their own thoughts and feelings.

          The child leads the play during sessions and has many different things
          to choose from such as, arts and crafts, toy people and animals,
          sensory play, dressing up etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The role of the play therapist is to facilitate the play in order to
          aid the childâ€™s understanding and healing of the hurt or upset they
          are feeling inside.
