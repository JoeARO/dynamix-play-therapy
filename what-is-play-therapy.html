          <p>
              When children suffer a traumatic event or are just finding things a little bit hard, words may be difficult to use when expressing how they feel.
          </p>
          <p>
              Play therapy is an opportunity for children to explore feelings and emotions through the form of play,
              taking pressure off needing to use words and focusing on a playful and more approachable method to help them without feeling interrogated or threatened.
          </p>
          <p>
              Play therapy can help in a variety of ways. Not only do they receive emotional support from the play therapist,
              they can also learn and understand more about their own thoughts and feelings.

          <p>The child leads the play during sessions and has many different things to choose from such as, arts and crafts, toy people and animals, sensory play, dressing up etc.</p> </p>
          <p>The role of the play therapist is to facilitate the play in order to aid the childâ€™s understanding and healing of the hurt or upset they are feeling inside.</p>
