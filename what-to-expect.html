          I am offering play therapy 2-3 days a week (Monday- Wednesday). This
          can be within schools, or privately in hired rooms as discussed and
          decided with the parents/guardians and schools if necessary. I have a
          mobile play therapy kit to make this possible.

          Play therapy is a form of therapy that happens at the same time, in
          the same place every week. The minimum amount of sessions would be
          12-15 and this would be decided at the beginning of the intervention
          with the child’s parents/guardians and school if the therapy takes
          place there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with seeing the child, it is important for parents/guardians to
          be involved and to support the child also. Confidentiality is key
          during any therapy and it is no different with children. To respect
          this, regular meetings (usually every 6 weeks) would happen with the
          parents/guardians to discuss the child’s process with the child’s
          permission. There would be an initial assessment meeting with the
          parent/guardian to discuss what they perceive the child’s needs to be
          and to assess what would be best for the child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular reports would be kept on file and an end of intervention
          report would be written for the parents/guardians and the school if
          this is appropriate.
