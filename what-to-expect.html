              Play therapy is a form of therapy that happens at the same time, in the same place every week.
              The minimum amount of sessions would be 12-15 and this would be decided at the beginning of the intervention with the child’s parents/guardians and school if the therapy takes place there.

              Along with seeing the child, it is important for parents/guardians to be involved and to support the child also.
              Confidentiality is key during any therapy and it is no different with children. To respect this, regular meetings (usually every 6 weeks) would happen with the parents/guardians to discuss the child’s process with the child’s permission. 
              There would be an initial assessment meeting with the parent/guardian to discuss what they perceive the child’s needs to be and to assess what would be best for the child.
          </p>
          <p>
              Regular reports would be kept on file and an end of intervention report would be written for the parents/guardians and the school if this is appropriate.

              I am offering play therapy 2-3 days a week (Monday- Wednesday).
              This can be within schools, or privately in hired rooms as discussed and decided with the parents/guardians and schools if necessary.
              I have a mobile play therapy kit to make this possible.
